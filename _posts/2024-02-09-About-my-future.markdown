title:  "What I might be doing in the next 10 years."

I'm going to list everything that I even gave a slight thought about doing for my career.

- ML/DL: Trending
- Quantum Computing: Trending
- Neurotechnology: Building technology to improve treatment for neural diseases
- Aerodynamics: Build a space map that shows you the force field along with the geographical map of the solar system. I'm pretty sure NASA has already built something more or less similar to this.

I seem to have more ideas, but I would be working somewhere boring doing tedious jobs everyday.  From a web crawer to solar system atlas, ideas might vary in its size and value to the world, but what is really important is that I do not stop building what I find exciting.
